# Java chess game

## Why chess?

I've always wanted to develop a simple console game with some preset rules and this quarantine was the perfect time to finally develop it to its fullest.

## What can it do?

- The board is drawn everytime a piece has been moved or when a given input was incorrect.
- Every piece can be moved just the way they can be moved in the real game.

## How can i run it?

Simply clone the project anywhere you like. Be sure to have java installed and simply execute the "rungame.bat" file.
